Hello GitHub Community ðŸ‘‹,


I am Anamol Acharya, an aspiring Full Stack Developer looking for full-time opportunities.
I recently graduated from Texas Tech University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.

Since childhood, I was interested in sketching and painting where I used to play with colors and I was runner up in an art competition in my school. The day when I realized about my passion is when I came up with an idea to develop my portfolio website in my sophomore year where I was introduced with html css and js. I found web development as a new style of art where we use css, js, and html to make beautiful websites. Since then I have been heavily working in web development. During my senior year, I was exposed to a full stack web devp project and was really fascinated with the technology. 

The most recent project I completed is a Movie Me app that helps users to locate streaming links for each movie searched by the user in different countries. We implemented MERN Stack for the development. The most exciting project that I have accomplished is to create an online food ordering app called Food Ranger using a self-created REST API in MERN stack. The user will be able search food and order food online based on the food options available and restaurants. I am also working on my personal project where students/professionals can practice the certification tests. I would be super happy if you have any exciting projects that I can be a part of.

I have hands-on experience in Software Developing using  Javascript, Node.js, ReactJS, MongoDB, and Java. I have also experience in creating/implementing RESTful APIs and host them in AWS Lambda. I find myself working in problem-solving, responsive design principles, Agile software development, and Model View Controller (MVC) methods of organizing code. 

I am enthusiastically open to learning new programming languages, frameworks, and libraries and work on positions that get me involved in any creative and technical areas.

And, about my hobbies, I like to play soccer and cook food when I am free and not working related to my profession. Did I forget to mention that I am competitive in Ping-Pong and have some great recipes for Potluck party! In the end, I would like to thank you very much for your time.

The best way to reach out me would be:
