Hello GitHub Community ðŸ‘‹,

I am an aspiring Full Stack Developer looking for full time opportunities.

I have hands on experience on Software Developing using  Javascript, Node.js, ReactJS, MongoDB, and Java. I have also experience on creating/implementing RESTful APIs and host it in AWS Lambda. I find myself working in problem-solving, responsive design principles, Agile software developing, and Model View Controller (MVC) methods of organizing code. 

I am enthusiastically open to learn new programming languages, frameworks, and libraries and work on positions that get me involved in any creative and technical areas.
Did I forget to mention that I am competitive in Ping-Pong and have some great recipes for Potlog party!
Thank you very much.
