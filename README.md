Hello GitHub Community ðŸ‘‹,

I am an aspiring Full Stack Developer looking for full time opportunities.

I have hands on experience on Software Developing using  Javascript, Node.js, ReactJS, MongoDB, and Java. I have also experience on creating/implementing RESTful APIs and host it in AWS Lambda. I find myself working in problem-solving, responsive design principles, Agile software developing, and Model View Controller (MVC) methods of organizing code.

I am enthusiastically open to learn new programming languages, frameworks, and libraries and work on positions that get me involved in any creative and technical areas.

I am currently working on projects based on MERN stack learning new things simultaneouly. Based on my experience in woorking with REST API, I am currently working in a project that will help the user to find the food in a specific location and order it online. I am also working on my personal project where students/professionals can practice the certification tests. I would be super happy if you have any exciting projects that I can be a part of. 
The best way to reach out me would be:

LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/anamol-acharya/

email:    anamol222@gmail.com

I love to play soccer in my spare time. Did I forget to mention that I am competitive in Ping-Pong and have some great recipes for Potlog party!

Thank you very much.
